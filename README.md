# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery ensures that the software arrives on time, satisfies customer expectations, and is under budget.  It also stops rivals from getting a competitive advantage.  Delays frequently result in increased expenditures, angry customers, and reputational damage.

**Project managers can do the following to meet deadlines**:
- Use Gantt charts or project management systems like Jira or Trello to establish defined milestones.
- Use a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to break down duties and simplify complex projects.
- Use Agile sprints to achieve iterative progress and receive frequent feedback.
- Conduct regular progress meetings to identify bottlenecks early.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control ensures that resources are used efficiently, reducing financial losses and keeping the project on budget.  It promotes more effective decision-making and resource allocation.
**Strategies to Avoid Budget Overruns**:
- *Accurate Estimation*: Create realistic cost estimates based on previous facts.
- *Continuous Monitoring*: Keep track of spending with programs like Microsoft Project or Asana.
- *Risk Management*: Set up a contingency budget (10-15% of total costs) to cover any unexpected charges.
- *Scope Management*: Keep scope creep at bay by documenting all project modifications and evaluating their financial impact.


## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
*Agile methodology* - is flexible and iterative, making it appropriate for projects with ever-changing requirements.  Development is separated into short sprints (usually 2-4 weeks) with frequent feedback.

**Advantages**:
 - Increased adaptability
 - Consumer interaction
 - Speedier issue resolution.
 - 
**Disadvantages**: 
 - Stakeholders must actively participate
 - Bad planning might result in misalignment.
*For example*
- An e-commerce company developing a shopping app may utilize Agile to release tiny features such as a payment gateway or wishlist, gaining feedback before the next sprint begins
